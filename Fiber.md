What is purpose of Fiber in React :

React Fiber is like this list of tasks for React to render and update your app's UI. Each task is called a "fiber." Before Fiber, React worked like a chef who could only focus on one task at a time. Once it started cooking pasta, for example, it couldn't stop until the pasta was done, even if the phone rang.

With Fiber, React can pause and resume tasks as needed, just like you can pause chopping vegetables to answer the phone and then resume chopping afterward. This allows React to prioritize tasks more effectively, making your app's UI smoother and more responsive.

In summary, React Fiber is a way for React to manage its tasks more efficiently, like a chef managing multiple cooking tasks in a busy kitchen. It helps improve the performance and responsiveness of your app's UI by allowing React to pause and resume tasks as needed.
